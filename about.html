            <h3>The first time I heard of UX Design was at the Grace Hopper Conference for Women in Computing. It felt like exactly what I had always dreamed of doing.
            <br><br>
            Since childhood, I have been inspired and motivated by creating and learning. I had a constant desire to tinker with new artistic pursuits and would teach myself new software and tools along the way. In high school, I took Graphic Design classes that helped solidify my desire for expertise in that field.   <br><br>     
            As I have gotten older, this transformed into design being my passion that gives me drive and motivation in life. I wish I had pursued design professionally originally, but I did not have the opportunity to at that time. 
            <br><br>
            Now, I am jumping on creating a future I can be proud of and promote happiness within myself, while easing the headaches of inaccessible designs for others.</h3>
